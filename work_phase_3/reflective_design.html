                                This annotation explains the rationale behind revising the
                                homepage text using inclusive and respectful language. The
                                revised version removes assumptions about the user's identity
                                and replaces vague or casual phrases with wording that welcomes
                                everyone.

                                For example, "this platform is built for you" became "this
                                platform is here for everyone." We also added phrases such as
                                "respect your identity" and "no matter your background,
                                ability, or level of experience"‚Äîaligned with the Australian
                                Government Style Manual on inclusive communication.

                                    <strong>Impact on Users:</strong> Screen reader users
                                    cannot distinguish between different navigation areas, as
                                    they are not uniquely identified. This reduces clarity and
                                    hinders efficient page orientation.

                                    <strong>How to fix:</strong> Add unique
