                        AI accelerated my workflow and boosted idea generation, but good
                        outcomes still depended on my detailed requirements, critical
                        judgement, and refinement. While AI provided valuable scaffolding and
                        summaries, its limitations reminded me to remain critical and take
                        ownership of the design process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final outcomes are curated by me: I made the design decisions,
                        ensured alignment with <strong>WCAG 2.2</strong> and
                        <strong>ACS values</strong>, and took responsibility for the integrity
                        of the work. AI supported the process, but the accountability is mine.
