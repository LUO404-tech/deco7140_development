                        Works as a primary school teacher, enjoys knitting and DIY crafts as a
                        creative outlet. Shares her work on Instagram, but feels mainstream
                        platforms don’t support detailed tutorials or niche community bonding.
                        Wants collaborative features (patterns exchange, project groups).

                            didn’t work was the lack of depth. Instagram is too visual for

                        4. What online features or tools (e.g., event listings, chat spaces,
                        mentorship, resource libraries) would make you feel more connected to
                        your community?
                    </p>
                    <div class="response">
                        <p>
                            An event directory for battles, workshops, and jams would be super
                            helpful. Also, a space where dancers, graffiti artists, and MCs can
                            collaborate — like shared project boards or chat groups. A
                            mentorship section, where experienced dancers can guide beginners,
                            would make the community stronger too.

                        5. Think about a time when you felt excluded or unwelcome in a hobby
                        community. What happened, and how could a website make the space feel
                        more inclusive?

                            Once at a local jam, the vibe felt cliquish — only certain crews
                            got attention, and newcomers were overlooked. Online, the same
                            thing happens when only “big names” get visibility. A website could
                            fix this by highlighting fresh talent, rotating featured artists,
                            and having spaces where beginners feel safe to share without
                            judgment.

                        6. How do you usually access your community content (e.g., mobile, PC,
                        slow internet)? How does this affect your experience?

                            I mostly use my phone, usually on the go between classes and
                            practice. Mobile-first design is key — if a site isn’t optimized,
                            it feels clunky and I just drop it. Quick loading and clean layouts
                            make the experience way smoother.

                        7. If you could design the perfect online space for your hobby or
                        subculture, what would it look like, and what features would it
                        include?

                                it should highlight newcomers too, not just the big names </span
