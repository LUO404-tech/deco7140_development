            <p class="impl-lead">
                This page explains how the WP4 build was implemented from the WP3 concept, how
                it aligns with the Connect Communities Initiative (CCI), and how accessibility
                and ethical decisions from earlier phases were carried through.
            </p>

            <!-- 1. Alignment -->
            <section class="impl-block" id="alignment">
                <h2 class="impl-heading">1. Alignment with Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>
                    The client stories described a platform for people who enjoy hobby and
                    subculture communities (cosplay, anime, dance, crafting, indie music) – not
                    just UQ students. WP4 keeps that broader audience: pages stay friendly,
                    ESL-readable, and interest driven.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Same IA as WP3:</strong> navigation follows the WP3 site map
                        (Home, Introduction, News, Community Hubs, Learning Studio, Community
                        Support) so returning users recognise the structure and new users can
                        browse by topic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Homepage welcome text reused:</strong> the welcome copy on
                        <code>homepage.html</code> is the revised, inclusive wording you wrote
                        in WP3, so the tone stays “for everyone who likes these communities”.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Learning Studio for newcomers:</strong> WP4 adds Learning
                        Studio with Beginner Guides and Video Tutorials so first-time visitors
                        can understand terms, culture, and safety before posting. This supports
                        the user need for a gentle, low-pressure onboarding.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>API pattern continued from WP3:</strong> as in WP3’s API
                        exercises, WP4 uses one GET to surface current community voices and one
                        POST (“Join the Community”) so any hobby fan can contribute without a
                        complex signup.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Login consistent with WP3 forms:</strong> the login page reuses
                        the WP3 form styling (bold labels, rounded card, blue primary button)
                        so the new feature does not break the visual system you established
                        earlier.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>CCI alignment:</strong> content is organised around interest
                        groups, has low-barrier input fields, and keeps clear labels, which
                        matches CCI’s goal of helping people join or form communities quickly.

            <section class="impl-block" id="accessibility-ethics">
                <h2 class="impl-heading">2. Accessibility and Ethical Considerations</h2>
                <p>
                    WP4 reuses the accessibility decisions from WP2/WP3 (semantic headings,
                    keyboard navigation, inclusive language) and applies them to the new
                    API-driven pages.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Keyboard &amp; focus:</strong> filter chips in
                        <code>hubs.html</code> use <code>aria-pressed</code> and can be
                        activated with Enter/Space, so keyboard-only users can switch
                        communities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Plain / ESL-friendly labels:</strong> forms use short field
                        labels (“Email”, “Password”, “Message (optional)”) and helper text,
                        following the WP3 style guide.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Minimal data collection:</strong> the community form only sends
                        what the DECO7140 API requires (name, email, category, message,
                        optional image), matching your WP2 ethics position of collecting only
                        necessary data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Consistent colour and contrast:</strong> the login card,
                        Learning Studio tiles, and implementation pages reuse the same blues
                        and rounded cards from WP3 to reduce cognitive load.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Support for newcomers:</strong> Learning Studio is an ethical
                        gesture towards new users – it lowers the knowledge barrier so no group
                        is excluded just because they are “new to cosplay/anime”.

                <h2 class="impl-heading">3. Variations from A3 Design Proposal</h2>
                <p>
                    A few changes were made while connecting the real API and finalising WP4,
                    but they stay within the original concept.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Inline replies:</strong> the API does not support threaded
                        replies, so a local inline-reply UI was added to each card. This keeps
                        the “community conversation” feeling from A3 without breaking the
                        endpoint.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Hashtag category prefix:</strong> messages posted through the
                        form are prefixed with <code>#cosplay</code>, <code>#knitting</code>,
                        etc. so the client-side filter can reliably group posts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Optimised images:</strong> hub/support cards use tighter image
                        sizing than the A3 mockups to improve UQCloud load time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Extra nav item (“Login”):</strong> the nav now includes
                        <code>login.html</code> so the form demo is discoverable from every
                        page.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="impl-note">
                    All variations were made for feasibility, performance, or API-integration
                    reasons and keep the WP3 visual language.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Single API list → multiple views:</strong> the endpoint returns
                        one flat list; the page adds client-side sorting and filtering so users
                        can browse by community without extra API calls.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Keeping nav consistent:</strong> all WP4 pages reuse the same
                        header markup and JS toggle so updates (like the Login link) only need
                        to be made once.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Form UX:</strong> to avoid confusing new hobby users, form
                        fields were kept short, with optional fields marked, and success
                        messages added after POST.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Matching WP3 typography:</strong> headings and card spacing
                        were aligned with the WP3 Style Guide so WP4 pages still “look like”
                        the project, even though they are API-driven.
