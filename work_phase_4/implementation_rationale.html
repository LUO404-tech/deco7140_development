                <p>
                    In WP3 I defined the audience as people who enjoy hobby and subculture
                    communities (cosplay, anime, dance, crafting, indie music, and related
                    interests). When building WP4 I kept the same audience, so the website
                    stays interest-driven, ESL-friendly, and easy to browse.
                </p>

                        I kept the WP3 site map –

                            >Home, Introduction, News, Community Hubs, Learning Studio,

                        >
                        – so anyone who saw the WP3 prototype can recognise the structure and
                        new visitors can navigate by page purpose.

                        the welcome on <code>homepage.html</code> keeps the inclusive,
                        community-first tone I wrote in WP3, so WP4 pages still speak to
                        “people who like these communities”, not to a narrow campus-only group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="impl-label">Learning Studio added for newcomers:</span>
                        I added a Learning Studio page with <em>Beginner Guides</em> and
                        <em>Video Tutorials</em> so people who are new to a hobby can get
                        context before visiting Community Hubs or posting.

                    <p>
                        <span class="impl-label">WP3 API practice carried over:</span>
                        WP4 uses the same pattern from WP3: one GET to load current community
                        voices, and one POST (“Join the Community”) so users can contribute
                        without a complex sign-up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="impl-label">Form style kept in the same system:</span>
                        the login page follows the WP3 form style (bold labels, rounded white
                        card, blue primary action) so the new page belongs visually to the same
                        project, even though WP4 added a second <em>Clear</em> button.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="impl-label">Card components inherited:</span>
                        I reused the rounded, shadowed cards from WP3 (Values Mapping Table,
                        reflective pages) for the hubs hero cards and the join form. This makes
                        WP4 visually consistent with the WP3 deliverables.

                        content is grouped by interests, input fields are low-barrier, and
                        labels are clear – this aligns with the Connect Communities Initiative
                        goal of helping people join or create communities quickly.

                <p>
                    I did not restart accessibility work from zero. Instead, I applied the
                    WP2/WP3 principles to the new API-based pages and to the login flow.

                        filter chips on <code>hubs.html</code> are buttons with
                        <code>aria-pressed</code>
                        and can be triggered with Enter/Space so keyboard-only users can change
                        the active community.

                        the community POST form only sends what the DECO7140 API needs (name,
                        email, category, message, optional image). This continues the privacy
                        decisions from the WP3 Values Mapping Table.

                        providing beginner material in the Learning Studio prevents new users

                        yet.

                        WP4 keeps the “everyone / users / people” wording from WP3 so content
                        stays neutral and respectful.

                <h2 class="impl-heading">3. Variations from A3 Design Proposal</h2>
                <p>
                    When I connected the real API and tested the pages, I made a few
                    adjustments. All of them stay inside the original concept.
                </p>
                <div class="impl-points">
                    <p>
                        <span class="impl-label">Inline reply on community posts:</span>
                        because the API does not provide threaded replies but A3 emphasised
                        interaction, I added a local inline-reply UI under each card so users
                        can respond in context without breaking the endpoint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="impl-label">Hashtag prefixes for filtering:</span>
                        posts are prefixed with tags like <code>#cosplay</code> or
                        <code>#anime</code> so the client-side filter can reliably group voices
                        by interest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="impl-label">Login actions extended:</span>
                        instead of a single “Submit” button like the WP3 demo, the WP4 login
                        card has both
                        <em>Sign in</em> and <em>Clear</em> so users can correct mistakes
                        quickly, especially on mobile.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="impl-label">Refreshed blue palette:</span>
                        I used the WP4 header blue on cards and buttons, instead of copying the
                        WP3 demo colour exactly. This keeps contrast good enough for the audit
                        and matches the final layout.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="impl-label">Image sizing adjusted:</span>
                        some hero/card images are tighter than the A3 mockups to load faster on
                        UQCloud.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="impl-label">Login added to global nav:</span>
                        I exposed <code>login.html</code> in the shared navigation so the
                        marker can reach the form from any page.

                        the endpoint returns one flat list, but I needed “by community” views.
                        I solved it on the client side with filtering and status messages so
                        users can switch categories without reloading.

                        I kept inputs short, marked optional fields clearly, and added
                        success/failure feedback after POST so users always know whether the
                        API call worked.

                    I ran the IBM <strong>Equal Access Accessibility Checker</strong> (Chrome

                    this page because it is the most complete WP4 example: shared navigation,
                    hero cards, filter chips, API-loaded voices, and the “Join the Community”
