                <p>
                    Overall, GenAI helped me move faster on repetitive front-end tasks and gave
                    me alternatives for DOM patterns I was not 100% confident about.

                        it suggested different ways to attach a copy-to-clipboard action, to
                        embed YouTube resources on the Learning page, and to show success /
                        error messages after a <code class="hl">POST</code>.

                        I compared the AI suggestions with the course API docs and only kept
                        the parts that matched the DECO7140 build.

                        some AI code overwrote or removed parts of my existing pages (for
                        example, it restyled containers or replaced helper text). Because of
                        that, I now <strong>always</strong> check the diff, keep my own version
                        as the source of truth, and write more precise prompts so the AI does
                        not touch layout or content that is already finished.

                        I will continue to use AI for small, traceable blocks, but I will keep
                        information architecture, content structure, and assessment text as my
                        own work.
